# Agent Instructions

## Commenting in MATLAB Files
- keep comments in lowercase, with uppercase allowed only for abbreviations (e.g., `ACC`).
- provide two types of comments:
  - section-by-section comments that explain the intention of the section. these can be full sentences across multiple lines if needed. do not prepend markers like "section:".
  - in-section comments that are concise, only when absolutely necessary, and just a few words long.
- avoid obvious or trivial comments. comment only what is absolutely necessary.
- do not over-comment. space out section-by-section comments by at least about five lines of actual code unless absolutely necessary.
- keep comments informal yet helpful.
